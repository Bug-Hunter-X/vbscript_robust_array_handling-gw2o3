'This improved function first checks if the array is empty. If so, it sets the count to 0 and exits. 
'It then iterates through the array, using IsNumeric to ensure each element is a number before comparison. 
'Error handling using On Error Resume Next and On Error GoTo 0 prevents the function from failing when the array contains unexpected elements.
